React Native VoIP Push Notification - Currently iOS >= 8.0 only

## Motivation

Since iOS 8.0 there is an execellent feature called **VoIP Push Notification** ([PushKit][1]), while in React Native only the traditional push notification is supported which limits the possibilities of building a VoIP app with React Native (like me!).

To understand the benefits of **Voip Push Notification**, please see [VoIP Best Practices][2].

**Note 1**: Not sure if Android support this sort of stuff since I'm neither an iOS nor Android expert, from my limited understanding that GCM's [sending high priority push notification][5] might be the case. Correct me if I'm wrong!

**Note 2** This module is inspired by [PushNotificationIOS][6] and [React Native Push Notification][7]

## RN Version

* 1.1.0+ ( RN 40+ )
* 2.0.0+ (RN 60+)

## !!IMPORTANT NOTE!!

#### You should use this module with CallKit:

Now Apple forced us to invoke CallKit ASAP when we receive voip push on iOS 13 and later, so you should check [react-native-callkeep](https://github.com/react-native-webrtc/react-native-callkeep) as well.

#### Please read below links carefully:

https://developer.apple.com/documentation/pushkit/pkpushregistrydelegate/2875784-pushregistry

> When linking against the iOS 13 SDK or later, your implementation of this method must report notifications of type voIP to the CallKit framework by calling the reportNewIncomingCall(with:update:completion:) method
>
> On iOS 13.0 and later, if you fail to report a call to CallKit, the system will terminate your app.
> 
> Repeatedly failing to report calls may cause the system to stop delivering any more VoIP push notifications to your app.
> 
> If you want to initiate a VoIP call without using CallKit, register for push notifications using the UserNotifications framework instead of PushKit. For more information, see UserNotifications.

#### Issue introduced in this change:

When received VoipPush, we should present CallKit ASAP even before RN instance initialization.  
  
This breaks especially if you handled almost call behavior at js side, for example:  
Do-Not-Disturb / check if Ghost-Call / using some sip libs to register or waiting invite...etc.  
  
Staff from Apple gives some advisions for these issues in the below discussion:
https://forums.developer.apple.com/thread/117939

#### You may need to change your server for APN voip push:

Especially `apns-push-type` value should be `'voip'` for iOS 13  
And be aware of `apns-expiration`value, adjust according to your call logics  
  
https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/sending_notification_requests_to_apns

#### About Silent Push ( Background Push ):

VoIP pushes were intended to specifically support incoming call notifications and nothing else.   

If you were using voip push to do things other than `nootify incoming call`, such as: `cancel call` / `background updates`...etc,  You should change to use [Notification Service Extension](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/unnotificationserviceextension), it contains different kind of pushs.

To  use`Background Push` to [Pushing Background Updates to Your App](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/usernotifications/setting_up_a_remote_notification_server/pushing_background_updates_to_your_app),
You should:
1. Make sure you enabled `Xcode` -> `Signing & Capabilities` -> `Background Modes` -> `Remote Notifications` enabled
2. When sending background push from your APN back-end, the push header / payload should set:
    * content-available = 1
    * apns-push-type = 'background'
    * apns-priority = 5


## Installation

```bash
npm install --save react-native-voip-push-notification
# --- if using pod
cd ios/ && pod install
```

The iOS version should be >= 8.0 since we are using [PushKit][1].

#### Enable VoIP Push Notification and Get VoIP Certificate

Please refer to [VoIP Best Practices][2].

Make sure you enabled the folowing in `Xcode` -> `Signing & Capabilities`:
* `Background Modes` -> `Voice over IP` enabled
* `+Capability` -> `Push Notifications`

#### AppDelegate.m Modification

```objective-c

...

#import <PushKit/PushKit.h>                    /* <------ add this line */
#import "RNVoipPushNotificationManager.h"      /* <------ add this line */

...

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
{

...

/* Add PushKit delegate method */

// --- Handle updated push credentials
- (void)pushRegistry:(PKPushRegistry *)registry didUpdatePushCredentials:(PKPushCredentials *)credentials forType:(PKPushType)type {
  // Register VoIP push token (a property of PKPushCredentials) with server
  [RNVoipPushNotificationManager didUpdatePushCredentials:credentials forType:(NSString *)type];
}

- (void)pushRegistry:(PKPushRegistry *)registry didInvalidatePushTokenForType:(PKPushType)type
{
  // --- The system calls this method when a previously provided push token is no longer valid for use. No action is necessary on your part to reregister the push type. Instead, use this method to notify your server not to send push notifications using the matching push token.
}


// --- Handle incoming pushes (for ios <= 10)
- (void)pushRegistry:(PKPushRegistry *)registry didReceiveIncomingPushWithPayload:(PKPushPayload *)payload forType:(PKPushType)type {
  [RNVoipPushNotificationManager didReceiveIncomingPushWithPayload:payload forType:(NSString *)type];
}

// --- Handle incoming pushes (for ios >= 11)
- (void)pushRegistry:(PKPushRegistry *)registry didReceiveIncomingPushWithPayload:(PKPushPayload *)payload forType:(PKPushType)type withCompletionHandler:(void (^)(void))completion {
  

  // --- NOTE: apple forced us to invoke callkit ASAP when we receive voip push
  // --- see: react-native-callkeep

  // --- Retrieve information from your voip push payload
  NSString *uuid = payload.dictionaryPayload[@"uuid"];
  NSString *callerName = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@ (Connecting...)", payload.dictionaryPayload[@"callerName"]];
  NSString *handle = payload.dictionaryPayload[@"handle"];

  // --- this is optional, only required if you want to call `completion()` on the js side
  [RNVoipPushNotificationManager addCompletionHandler:uuid completionHandler:completion];

  // --- Process the received push
  [RNVoipPushNotificationManager didReceiveIncomingPushWithPayload:payload forType:(NSString *)type];

  // --- You should make sure to report to callkit BEFORE execute `completion()`
  [RNCallKeep reportNewIncomingCall:uuid handle:handle handleType:@"generic" hasVideo:false localizedCallerName:callerName fromPushKit: YES];
  
  // --- You don't need to call it if you stored `completion()` and will call it on the js side.
  completion();
}
...

@end

```

## Linking:

On RN60+, auto linking with pod file should work.  
Or you can try below:

## Linking Manually:

### Add PushKit Framework:

- In your Xcode project, select `Build Phases` --> `Link Binary With Libraries`
- Add `PushKit.framework`

### Add RNVoipPushNotification:

#### Option 1: Use [rnpm][3]

```bash
rnpm link react-native-voip-push-notification
```

**Note**: If you're using rnpm link make sure the `Header Search Paths` is `recursive`. (In step 3 of manually linking)

#### Option 2: Manually

1. Drag `node_modules/react-native-voip-push-notification/ios/RNVoipPushNotification.xcodeproj` under `<your_xcode_project>/Libraries`
2. Select `<your_xcode_project>` --> `Build Phases` --> `Link Binary With Libraries`
  - Drag `Libraries/RNVoipPushNotification.xcodeproj/Products/libRNVoipPushNotification.a` to `Link Binary With Libraries`
3. Select `<your_xcode_project>` --> `Build Settings`
  - In `Header Search Paths`, add `$(SRCROOT)/../node_modules/react-native-voip-push-notification/ios/RNVoipPushNotification` with `recursive`

## Usage:

```javascript

...

import VoipPushNotification from 'react-native-voip-push-notification';

...

class MyComponent extends React.Component {

...

  componentDidMount() { // or anywhere which is most comfortable and appropriate for you
    VoipPushNotification.requestPermissions(); // --- optional, you can use another library to request permissions
    VoipPushNotification.registerVoipToken(); // --- required
  
    VoipPushNotification.addEventListener('register', (token) => {
      // --- send token to your apn provider server
    });

    VoipPushNotification.addEventListener('localNotification', (notification) => {
      // --- when user click local push
    });

    VoipPushNotification.addEventListener('notification', (notification) => {
      // --- when receive remote voip push, register your VoIP client, show local notification ... etc
      //this.doRegisterOrSomething();
      
       // --- This  is a boolean constant exported by this module
       // --- you can use this constant to distinguish the app is launched by VoIP push notification or not
       if (VoipPushNotification.wakeupByPush) {
         // this.doSomething()

         // --- remember to set this static variable back to false
         // --- since the constant are exported only at initialization time, and it will keep the same in the whole app
         VoipPushNotification.wakeupByPush = false;
       }


       // --- optionally, if you `addCompletionHandler` from the native side, once you have done the js jobs to initiate a call, call `completion()`
       VoipPushNotification.onVoipNotificationCompleted(notification.getData().uuid);


      /**
       * Local Notification Payload
       *
       * - `alertBody` : The message displayed in the notification alert.
       * - `alertAction` : The "action" displayed beneath an actionable notification. Defaults to "view";
       * - `soundName` : The sound played when the notification is fired (optional).
       * - `category`  : The category of this notification, required for actionable notifications (optional).
       * - `userInfo`  : An optional object containing additional notification data.
       */
      VoipPushNotification.presentLocalNotification({
          alertBody: "hello! " + notification.getMessage()
      });
    });
  }
...
}
